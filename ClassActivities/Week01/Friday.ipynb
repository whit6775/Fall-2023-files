        "\n",
        "### Three ways to interact with python\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more than just three, but the methods described below will show the variety of options well.  Of course, you can also run python directly in our textbook, or using a site like replit.com, which allows you to try out code quickly if you are online.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Inside a Jupyter (iPython) notebook \n",
        "Just like this one.  This is our main way we will play with python in this course.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Using an interactive session\n",
        "As long as you have python installed you can \"run\" python by opening up a **terminal** or **command prompt** and typing `python`.  Let's try this now.  \n",
        "1. Inside of VS Code (i.e., your codespace), if you don't se a terminal at the bottom of the screen, go to the \"hamburger\" menu, select Terminal, then New Terminal.\n",
        "2. Click on the terminal and type `python` and then hit ENTER.\n",
        "3. You will see a message about what version of python you have, but then `>>>`.  This is where you can type a command.\n",
        "4. You can now enter any python code.  Try `2+3` and hit ENTER.  Then try `x = 10/5` (ENTER) and then `print(x)`.\n",
        "5. When you are done playing, type `quit()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Running a python script in a file\n",
        "Often we want to save a python program that can be run anytime we want.  For example, you might want to write a python \"script\" that looks for all `.png` image files in a folder and converts them to black-and-white.  You wouldn't want to remember all the commands for this to type one-at-a-time in an interactive session.  \n",
        "\n",
        "So instead, you put all the commands in a file, and tell python to run that file.  Let's try it:\n",
        "1. Open the file `sample.py` (at the root of your repository)\n",
        "2. Read the python code there.  What do you think will happen when the program runs?\n",
        "3. To run the program, in the terminal, type `python sample.py` (ENTER).\n",
        "4. Interact with the program.  Does it do what you expect?\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, if you edit the file, and run it again, it can do something different.  This will be how you submit some of your larger homework assignments.\n",
        "\n",
